# Anton Smirnov's Portfolio

Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of Python and SQL and combination of both that I've written for my projects. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amymartikabrown/) if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects
* **School cafeteria violations analysis** - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amymartika/viz/ExecutiveOverview_16733205488000/ExecutiveOverview), [Python and SQL](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amymartika/viz/ExecutiveOverview_16733205488000/ExecutiveOverview)]: In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze the nature and causes of School cafeteria violations in New York City boroughs. I focused on critical violations that pose a high risk to public health. My process entailed importing, cleaning, and organizing data and performing EDA in Python and SQL and visualizing with Tableau. 

* **Walmart Sales Analaysis** - [SQL](https://github.com/feelgd777/SQL_repo/blob/main/Wallmart%20Sales%20Analysis): In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends of Walmart sales. I created a database and used queries to filter data and answer business questions.

* **US Airlines tweets sentiment analysis** - [Python](https://github.com/amymartika/SQL/blob/main/Predicting%20Book%20Ratings): In this project, I used the nltk package in Python to process live tweets and classify the negative sentiments directed at US Airlines. Labeled data used for model training is on Kaggle. My process entailed nltk data cleaning, vectorization, model tuning, and building an API to analyze live tweets.
